# Description

In this repository, DOM manipulation has been done using JavaScript for different scenarios in three folders. I solved the problems with my own unique approaches, using my own methods in these projects based on **Jonas Schmedtmann**'s JavaScript course.

## Project 1- Guess My Number

This project includes a simple number guessing game. In each new game initiated by the user, a random number between 1 and 20 is determined using the JS Math module.

The user is expected to enter a number in the input field. If the user enters an invalid number (outside the range of 1 to 20), a warning is given to the user.

After each guess made by the user, it is indicated whether the guessed number is greater or less than the number that needs to be found. The earlier the user finds the hidden number, the higher their score will be.

Each of these steps has been achieved through DOM manipulation to reach the final application.

## Project 2- Modal

The goal of this project is to make an information window open when we click on any of the three different buttons on the page.

And we want to be able to close these information windows by clicking outside of the information window with the mouse or by pressing the 'ESC' key on the keyboard.

## Project 3- Pig Game

In this project, we offer the user a dynamically playable dice rolling game, either alone or with a friend. In each new game initiated by the user, the scores are reset, and they start rolling the dice again.

They temporarily gain points based on the value rolled on the dice. If a 1 is rolled, they lose the temporarily accumulated points.
